Simple program to read history files, exported from Jasmine ( Android program ). Currently program supports old format ( .jpha ) and new format ( .jha2 ).

Program can export history to text files, and import text files to jasmine history format ( this is quite hard to do ).

Expect some bad code, this is done with almost no knowledge in java and SWT.

For building you will need Gradle ( http://www.gradle.org/ ). IF you want exe as an output, download Launch4j ( http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ ) and point to it in your PATH.
